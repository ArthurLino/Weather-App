# Weather-App

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world! Here's a simple weather app beeing made for studying js basics.")
```

I am building it using the OpenWeatherAPI, JS, HTML and CSS.

### How does it work(at this moment):
* Mainly the user has one main card that shows him/her the nearby weather, this functionality uses the navigator.geolocation object, so, if the user does not give permission to
the browser for accessing the location, the main card will start displaying nothing but icons.
* The user can also use the search-bar to get somewheres weather.
